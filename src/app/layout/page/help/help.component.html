   <p>1.The homepage contains eight menu bars, including home, compound, target,
     pathway, search, tool, links, help and contact. To browse the entries,
     the users can click the each sub-menus in the compound, target and pathway.
     The corresponding entries will be displayed.

   <p>2.In the search page, users can obtain the entries of glaucoma-related
     drugs and proteins by searching various keywords, such as drug name and
     protein name of interest in the “Keyword Search” page. Alternatively, users
     can search specific structure by sketching in the “Structure Search” page.
     Users can specify structure types for query, such as substructure search
     and similarity search. A compound similarity or substructure search of the
     GCDB can then be carried out to retrieve compounds similar to or containing
     the input molecule.

   <p>3.In the tool page, users can sketch a structure of interest in the JME
     applet window or input a molecule in SMILES format into the “SMILES” txt box
     in the “Target Identification” sub-menus for identifying the potential
     glaucoma-related proteins. After clicking “Target Prediction” button, a list
     of potential protein targets will be returned in the result page after 1 ~ 2 min.
     The predictive results of multiple-voting SEA model are based on four types of
     molecular fingerprints - topological, atom pair, maccs and morgan. Significance
     level of P value in each fingerprint prediction is used to indicate the
     significance of raw similarity score. Predictions with P value ≤ 0.05 are
     considered as promising targets.

   <p>Users also can upload a file with multiple molecules stored in SDF or SMILES
     format in the “Chemical Screening” sub-menus and provide a valid e-mail address
     for receiving calculation results. Based on users' preferences, single protein
     can be selected one time in the pull-down menus as the target for virtual screening.
     After uploading the molecules, click the “Submit” button to submit user’s job.
     Having retrieving a list of compounds, the potential targets can be calculated
     on the backend server of GCDB. A typical run containing a molecule takes 1~2 min,
     while the run time will depend on the number of molecules.

   <p>4.In the links page, users can access to two independent algorithms -
     “PharmMapper” and “ChemMapper” based on ligand structure predictions using
     pharmacophore mapping approach and the molecular 3D similarity calculation
     strategies to identify potential target candidates for the given compounds,
     respectively.
