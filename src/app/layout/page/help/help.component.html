   <p>1.The homepage contains nine pull-down menus: home, compound, target,
     pathway, search, tool, links, help and contact in the toolbar, and users
     can browse relevant entries by clicking their sub-menus. The corresponding
     entries will be displayed.

   <p>2.In the search page, users can search various keywords, such as drug
     name and protein name. Alternatively, users can search a specific structure
     by sketching it in the JME applet window. Users can specify structure types
     for query, such as substructure search and similarity search, and click the
     “Search” button to deliver a query molecule to GCDB Server. The bioactive
     molecules are returned with 3D similar to query molecule.

   <p>3.In the tool page, users can utilise the SEA online computing algorithm
     tool to predict possible targets of a query molecule by clicking the “Target
     Identification” sub-menu. Users can sketch a structure in the JME applet window
     or input a molecule in SMILES format into the “SMILES” txt box as the query, and
     click “Target Prediction” button to submit a job. The potential protein targets
     will be returned in the result page after 2 ~ 3 min. The potential protein targets
     are returned based on the predictive results of a multiple-voting SEA model with
     four types of molecular fingerprints - topological, atom pair, maccs and morgan.
     The P-value is used to indicate the significance of the raw similarity score.
     Predictions with significance level P-values ≤ 0.05 are considered promising targets.

   <p>Users can upload a file with multiple molecules (at most 1000) stored in sdf or
     SMILES formats via “Chemical Screening” sub-menus and provide a valid e-mail address
     for receiving calculation results. A single protein can be selected one time in the
     pull-down menus as the target for virtual screening. Users can click the “Submit”
     button to deliver the query molecules to GCDB Server. After retrieving the users’
     job successfully, the calculation starts on the backend server of GCDB. A typical
     run containing a molecule takes 2 ~ 3 min, while the run time will depend on the
     number of molecules.

   <p>4.In the links page, users can access to two independent algorithms
     - “PharmMapper” and “ChemMapper” that use pharmacophore mapping approach and
     the molecular 3D similarity calculation strategies, respectively, to identify
     potential target candidates for the desired molecules.
