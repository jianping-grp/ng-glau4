      <b>Glaucoma</b> is a group of neurodegenerative diseases which affects 60 ~ 70 million people worldwide, is a
      painless neurodegenerative disorder and the second cause of blindness after cataracts, resulting in optic nerve
      damage and irreversible blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>GCDB</b> is one platform available for either to identify potential drug targets or to screen new drug
      scaffolds for glaucoma treatments. <b>GCDB</b> contains 275 genes, 105 proteins, 40 approved drugs, 90 206
      chemicals associated with 213 093 records of reported glaucoma bioactivities from 22 324 glaucoma
      corresponding bioassays and 5 630 references.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glaucoma database website allows analysis of pharmacological target space and searching for the
      drugs as well as targets of interest. The platform also provides implementation of a ligand-based
      computational algorithm for virtual screening and target prediction, by assessing the activity of a query
      molecule based on its similarity to the active ligands for a given target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>GCDB</b> will be helpful in target identification and chemogenomics data exchanging and sharing in glaucoma,
      and facilitate the drug discovery for glaucoma treatment.
